### Image Viewer

This simple image viewer draws images from my [500px account](https://500px.com/fauntle) and displays them in a lightbox with a previous/next navigation system. In the interest of time I've stopped here, but here are a few things I would've loved to do:

- Have the image viewer automatically adjust to fit within the width/height of the browser window.
- Make the initial state—when the image viewer first loads—more informative
- Actually handle error states
- Get every CSS transition working in every target browser
